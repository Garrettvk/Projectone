1. COLLECTING DATA

    www.wonatrading.com  website to be scraped – this process needs to be automated to be run once a week as they are new products added once a week.
    What needs to be taken from the website is: 

    a) CATERGORIES
    b) LEVEL 1 CATERGORIES
    c) LEVEL 2 CATERGORIES
    d) PRODUCT NAME
    e) IMAGE LINK (Sometimes there can be 2 images that needs to be accounted for)
    f) DESCRIPTION
    g) PRICE
    EXAMPLE:
    JEWELRY > ANKLET > FASHION > STARFISH RHINESTONE LAYERED ANKLET > https://www.wonatrading.com/images/20200305/AK022-@GD-CRY@1H-8_15L@478951@375@01.jpg / https://www.wonatrading.com/images/20200305/des_img/AK022-@GD-CRY@1H-8_15L@478951@375@01@1.jpg > • Style No : 478951

    This  data needs to be entered into a table or database .

2. COMBINE ANY PRODUCTS THAT ARE THE SAME  BUT JUST DIFFERENT COLORS.

    EXAMPLE:
    STARFISH RHINESTONE LAYERED ANKLET: THERE ARE 2 PRODUCTS THAT HAVE THE SAME PRODUCT NAME  BUT DIFFERENT ID NUMBERS(478951, 478952) , DIFFERENT COLORS(gold , rhodium)
    AND DIFFERENT IMAGE LINKS BUT NEED TO BE COMBINED BECAUSE THEY ARE VARIANTS OF EACH

3. CLEAN DATA

    General clean, check for spelling, casing, remove an extra space etc.
    Description: remove style number (put it into its own separate column), where it’s made and product name. 
    Price: remove the dollar sign and /pc, /dz . the price will need the original price and in a separate column price *2
